# Design-and-Verification-of-an-LC-3-Microcontroller-Using-SV-Testbench-and-Bubble-Sort-Execution
Implemented the LC-3 microcontroller in SystemVerilog, including control unit, datapath, and memory. Verified each block with directed testbenches, then validated the full system using a SystemVerilog test environment (generator, monitor, scoreboard etc). Ran bubble sort firmware in LC-3 assembly to show correct execution.
